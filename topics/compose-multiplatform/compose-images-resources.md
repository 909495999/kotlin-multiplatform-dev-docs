[//]: # (title: Images and resources)

// TODO

* Tune and migrate content from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/tree/master/tutorials/Image_And_Icons_Manipulations), 
which describes how to manage local images. This tutorial will change when we provide common API for managing resources across platforms.
* Recommend third-party libraries for loading resources from Internet.
* Recommend [MOKO resources from IceRock](https://github.com/icerockdev/moko-resources) for managing other resources.
