[//]: # (title: Navigation and routing)

// TODO

* Tune and migrate content from GitHub about [desktop navigation](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/tree/master/tutorials/Navigation) (consider removing Decompose) and [tab navigation](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/tree/master/tutorials/Tab_Navigation).
* Recommend third-party libraries for navigation across platforms.
* Add a note that iOS-like navigation will be available later and refer to the [roadmap](roadmap.md).
