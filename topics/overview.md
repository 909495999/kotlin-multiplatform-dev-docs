[//]: # (title: Multiplatform Development solution overview)

// Draft

Multiplatform development empowers you and your team to save valuable time and resources, focusing on true coding thanks to reusing code across platforms.
This approach considerably reduces the number of lines of code to write, test, and maintain.

The Multiplatform Development solution combines all technologies and products created by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) for 
flexible cross-platform development in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

The solution includes:
* **Kotlin Multiplatform**, a technology that allows sharing code across different platforms, including Android, iOS, backend, desktop (macOS, Windows, and Linux), web, and others
* **Compose Multiplatform**, a declarative framework for sharing UIs across diverse platforms
* **Tooling** that streamlines and makes multiplatform development enjoyable

Thanks to flexible sharing provided by the JetBrains solution, you can switch to multiplatform development at any stage of your project without the risk of losing your Kotlin-written code.
You have the freedom to decide how much and when to share. This enables incremental adoption for existing projects and is especially beneficial for projects with complex logic.

Flexibility extends beyond logic to UI. If you want to save time and use a common UI that might not appear native on all platforms, Compose Multiplatform is your best bet.
If your preference is a UI native for each platform, we support that too. The choice is yours!

Kotlin Multiplatform is already used in production by many companies, including Philips, Netflix, Leroy Merlin, and VMWare. 
Other companies, such as Instabee and SpeedNet, have already started experimenting with Compose Multiplatform in their 
Kotlin Multiplatform projects and received significant results.

> Compose for iOS really simplified adding support for iOS. The level of shared code, without adding complexity, is staggering. 
> It really streamlines app development and enables us to innovate and iterate at insane speed. - _Instabee_

If you are already a Kotlin developer, you can easily transition to a multiplatform developer without learning additional technologies 
and this way increase your market value.

If you're just considering Kotlin, it's an ideal choice no matter whether you decide to become a cross-platform or single-platform developer. 
Developed by JetBrains and contributors, Kotlin is popular in mobile, backend, multiplatform, and desktop development.
