[//]: # (title: Multiplatform development overview)

// Draft

Multiplatform development empowers you and your team to save valuable time and resources, focusing on true coding thanks to reusing code across platforms.
This approach considerably reduces the number of lines of code to write, test, and maintain.

[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) integrates a variety of technologies and products for flexible cross-platform development in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), encompassing:

* **Kotlin Multiplatform**, a technology that allows sharing code across different platforms, including Android, iOS, backend, desktop (macOS, Windows, and Linux), web, and others
* **Compose Multiplatform**, a declarative framework for sharing UIs across diverse platforms
* **Tooling** that streamlines and makes multiplatform development enjoyable

Flexible sharing capabilities allow you to transition to multiplatform development at any stage of your project, preserving your existing Kotlin code and ensuring seamless integration with platform-specific SDKs. 
You have the freedom to decide how much and when to share and incrementally adopt Kotlin Multiplatform at your own pace. This approach is especially beneficial for projects with complex logic.

Flexibility extends beyond logic to UI. If you're looking to save time and use a common UI, which might not appear entirely native on all platforms, Compose Multiplatform is your go-to. 
Native interoperability enables the mixing of Compose and native components, even within a single screen, helping you achieve a UI as close to native as you desire. 
If your preference is a completely native UI for each platform, we support that too. The choice is entirely yours!

Kotlin Multiplatform is already used in production by many companies, including Philips, Netflix, Leroy Merlin, and VMWare. 
Other companies, such as Instabee and SpeedNet, have already started experimenting with Compose Multiplatform in their 
Kotlin Multiplatform projects and received significant results.

> Compose for iOS really simplified adding support for iOS. The level of shared code, without adding complexity, is staggering. 
> It really streamlines app development and enables us to innovate and iterate at insane speed. - _Instabee_

If you are already a Kotlin developer, you can easily transition to a multiplatform developer without learning additional technologies 
and this way increase your market value.

If you're just considering Kotlin, it's an ideal choice no matter whether you decide to become a cross-platform or single-platform developer. 
Developed by JetBrains and contributors, Kotlin is popular in mobile, backend, multiplatform, and desktop development.
