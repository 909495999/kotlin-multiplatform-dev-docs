[//]: # (title: Multiplatform Development solution overview)

// Placeholder

The Multiplatform Development solution combines all technologies and products created by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) for multiplatform development in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

It includes:
* Kotlin Multiplatform, a technology that allows sharing code across different platforms
* Compose Multiplatform, a declarative framework for sharing UIs across diverse platforms
* Tooling that streamlines and makes multiplatform development enjoyable

Multiplatform developments empowers you and your team to save valuable time and resources, focusing on true coding thanks to reusing code across platforms. 
This approach considerable reduces the number of lines of code to write, test, and maintain.

Thanks to flexible sharing provided by the JetBrains solution, you can switch to multiplatform development at any stage of your project without the risk of losing your Kotlin-written code.
You have the freedom to decide how much and when to share. This enables incremental adoption for existing projects and is especially beneficial for projects with complex logic.

Flexibility extends beyond logic to UI. If you want to save time and use a shared UI that might not appear native on all platforms, Compose Multiplatform is your best bet.
If your preference is a native UI for each platform, we support that too. The choice is yours!

If you are already a Kotlin developer, you can easily transition to a cross-platform developer without learning additional technologies 
and this way increase your market value. If you're just considering Kotlin, it's an ideal choice no matter whether you decide to 
become a cross-platform or single-platform developer. Developed by JetBrains and open-source contributors, Kotlin is popular 
in Android, backend, multiplatform, and desktop development. You decide what to develop!
